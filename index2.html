        <td>During high school, many students take part-time jobs in the weekend or after school. It is a good idea to have a part-time job before graduating from high school. Students become responsible, earn pocket money, and have interpersonal skills. First and foremost, having a job before graduating from high school makes teenagers responsible. When students get a part-time job, they are expected to be at work on time. If they are late, they get fired. Having a job also lets students prove students can be trusted. Often in both fast food restaurants and retail stores, students are around money. Handling money is a big responsibility as the owners are trusting you with their profits. Therefore, students will gain responsibility as they handle money in their part time jobs. Second, having a part-time job will allow students to save money. Both college and university are expensive. An education could cost students up to $30,000. It is unfair to have students’ parents pay for post secondary education. With a part-time job, students will be able to save money for college. Even if students do not go off to college, students will have some money in the bank when students graduate. No matter the path a student takes after high school, it is a good idea to have some money saved. Finally, a part-time job will allow students to gain independence. First, high school students have pride. They don’t want to run to their parents for money to go to the movies or buy clothes. Morevoer, today’s teens have expensive items such as clothes, shoes, and phones. Parents are not always going to open their wallets for these items. A job will allow a student to gain independence because they will not have to rely on parents for their entertainment. To conclude, it is a good idea to have a part-time job before graduating from high school. If students have a part time job, students become responsible, students can save money, and students gain independence. The government and society should pay more attention to make sure that high school students could be able to have the best education without distraction of misleading and material addiction.</td>
